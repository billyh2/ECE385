2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]

It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

There is a large setup violation of -6.024 ns between vga/vc_reg[2]_replica_1/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and purple_board/purple_board/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.SIMPLE_PRIM18.ram/ADDRARDADDR[11] (clocked by clk_out2_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
